In this exercise we will practice using GIT.  This will allow everyone to practice the following:

- Cloning a repository
- Pulling from the main branch
- Creating a branch
- Adding to specific changes to the website
- Submit a pull request (on GitHub)
- Get pull request merged
- Update your branch with completed project

This is the typical GIT workflow on a project.
